# QR Code Generation Script Explanation

This script allows you to generate unique QR codes based on data from a CSV file. Let's break it down.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have these libraries installed:
- os
- pandas (`pd`)
- qrcode

To install them, you can use:
\```bash
pip install pandas qrcode[pil]
\```

## Importing Libraries

\```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import qrcode
\```

These libraries allow for file management, data handling, and QR code generation.

## Reading the Data

\```python
df = pd.read_csv('qr_generate.csv')
\```

This line reads a CSV file named `qr_generate.csv` and loads the data into a DataFrame named `df`.

## Structure of the Data


Each of the six columns in the DataFrame will be looped over to generate a unique QR code for each value.

## Checking and Creating Base Folder

\```python
base_folder = 'QR_codes'
if not os.path.exists(base_folder):
    os.makedirs(base_folder)
\```

This ensures there's a base folder named 'QR codes' to save the generated QR codes. If it doesn't exist, it creates one.

## QR Code Generation

Looping through the columns, the script does the following:
- Creates a folder for each column inside 'QR codes' if it doesn't exist.
- Loops over each unique value in the column.
- Generates a QR code for that value.

\```python
for column in df.columns:
    ...
    for value in df[column].unique():
        ...
        img.save(os.path.join(folder_path, f'{filename}.png'))
\```

Special care is taken to ensure filenames are safe (replacing spaces and special characters).

## Finishing Up

\```python
print('All QR codes generated successfully!')
\```

After all the QR codes are generated, you'll get a confirmation message.

## Conclusion

With this script, you can quickly and efficiently generate QR codes from a CSV file and organize them neatly in folders. Just make sure you have the `qr_generate.csv` file in the same directory as the script.
